### 3. **Type Your Code**
By default, onlineGDB loads in some code. You can delete this code and place your own code instead.

### 4. **Run Your Code**
Run your code by pressing the green Run button or if you want to be fast, by 'F9' on your keyboard.

# Now You Can Run All Your Code Without Installing A Thing
Congratulations! Now you can practice programming in C as much as you want.
