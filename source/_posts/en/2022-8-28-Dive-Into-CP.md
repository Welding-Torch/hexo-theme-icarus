_Key Takeaways from TSEC CodeCell's Dive Into Code_

- Seminar by [Saket Thota](https://codeforces.com/profile/palindroam) & [Tushar Nankani](https://codeforces.com/profile/tusharnankani)  
- Note: [*Last Year's Virtual Seminar By CodeCell*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHPjbt2BMW8)

### What is CP?

Competitive Programming. It's more of a mind sport than a coding challenge.
CP is about focusin on time, efficiency and accuracy.

**Author's note**: Please read the entire post and visit the approprate links. A great care has been taken into writing this and formulating the resources. If you come across some new term, please do not assume and learn it's meaning. 

### Why do CP?

It helps one:
- with developing Problem Solving skills. 
- to be a quick thinker. 
- to think about efficency in terms of time and memory limits.
- And also, it is a part of recruitment/shortlisting for some companies for full time job roles.

If we take a broader look, and zoom out a little from this scenario â€” it emulates real time problem solving. 

- Reading the problem and understanding it.
- Understanding the requirements. 
- Thinking about an approach. (Design)
- Thinking about efficency. (Feasability)
- Coding out the problem. (Development)
- Result of the problem. (Speed, Time, Testing)

### How to get started with CP?

### Level 1: Learn a language. 

#### Which programming language to choose from?

**Fact:** Language doesn't matter. You can start with any. Opinion: If you're a beginner, you can start with C++. Java syntax can be overwhelming. Python is slower at runtime and could give TLEs, while other languages could give `Accepted` with the same approach.

**Another Fact:** There are certain performance benefits of using C++, however there are several people such as Petr (Java) and pajanegod (Python) who have reached 2400+ on Codeforces without using C++.

#### How do I get started with learning a language?

Any place which covers the basics right works.
Opinion: Focus more on doing it than sticking to books or tutorials. A great place to evaluate your skills can be [Hackerrank]([url](https://www.hackerrank.com/)). 

Hackerrank > Prepare By Topics > Choose A Language.

Then, move to [Problem Solving](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms).

### Level 2: Practice. 

Now, could be the time to take a shot at platforms like [Codeforces](http://codeforces.com), [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com), etc. 

- **Getting Started on** [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/selflearning/0to1stars), [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/99660) 

- **Problems on** [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/practice?End_rating=999) , [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/problemset?Order=BY_RATING_ASC) .

*(difficulty increasing progressively)* 

Another tool to help aid this gradual difficulty level is [A2OJ ladders](https://a2oj.netlify.app/ladders).

### Level 3: Give Contest

#### What are contests?

Solving a few problem statements under given amount of time. They are a great way to upskill yourself and maintain good speed.

Give contests with your peer group *(more at the end)*. After giving a contest, compare your code with with someone with good rating and someone who's code you can understand. Discuss.

#### Some contests suggestions.

Strategies :
- Solving effectively
- Taking part in contest
- **Upsolving*** 
- Editorial Reading.

**Upsolving**: 
- Solve the sums you couldn't do. Look at others code their way of implementation.
- While reading editorial. Don't read the entire code.
- Read one line try to think what the implementation could be, second line...and so on.
- If you don't understand, then see the whole code.
- But try to implement and write code on your own.

### Mistakes To Avoid.

- Switching between problems. 
  - Now, if you're coding your subconscious mind keeps thinking about the previous question. It is recommended not switch in between problems until and unless you've exhausted your thoughts.

- Being in your comfort zone.  
  - One thing, don't solve a same rating problem continuously. There will be a point where you'll realize that you're comfortable with these level sums. Increase the difficulty gradually. 

- For beginners please don't wait to solve complete tutorials. Chances are you'll forget overtime. Practice.

Note: Writing the code is the easiest thing to do. Thinking about how should you proceed and finding the corner case is something which will make you a problem solver. Then comes implementation. Read the problem statement properly. Don't use the hint until it's too necessary.

### Contests to look if you are beginner : 

- [AtCoder's](https://atcoder.jp), ABC every Saturday 5 PM IST
- [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com), STARTER every Wednesday 8 PM IST

#### Some Prestigious Contests:

- [ICPC](https://icpc.global) (Internation Collegiate Programming Contest)
- [Google Kickstart, Hashcode and CodeJam](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com)
- [Facebook Hacker Cup](https://www.facebook.com/codingcompetitions/hacker-cup)
- Codechef Snackdown

### Looking for peers?

If you are beginner and looking for peers or post contest discussions, you are free to join.
