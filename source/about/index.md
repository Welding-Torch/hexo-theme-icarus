👋 Good day, everyone! 
*GeekSpace* is pleased to welcome you.

This community is for people who are passionate about technology as well as those who want to learn about the newest developments in the field 👨🏻‍💻 

We usually talk about technology, exchange memes, and provide feedback on tech keynotes - everything worth talking about is shared here. 

The nicest thing about the individuals here is their extensive background knowledge 🙇🏻‍♂️, whether it's setting up Linux 🖥️ or flash AOSP Custom Roms 📱 or even assisting you in buying new laptop 💻.  Everything to do with technology is covered here🦾

You're encouraged to share your questions, and everyone here is incredibly helpful; someone will undoubtedly assist you 🤗
 
Oh, and this isn't your coding group—though we do talk about it— but it's more of a hangout place for techies. 👾
